What's new in version 0.2?
--------------------------

Completly changed the way pyccn was being imported. Now the pyccn is imported
in a very similar way to other Python modules.
For example, the old way of importing looked like this:

from pyccn import *
handle = CCN.CCN()
key = handle.getDefaultKey()

The new version is:

import pyccn
handle = pyccn.CCN()
key = handle.getDefaultKey()

The Name objet is now immutable, all opperations that were modifying Name's
contents now return a new Name object. For example:

Old way:
from pyccn import Name

n = Name.Name('/hello/world')
segment = Name.Name(n)
n.appendSegment(42)

New way:
import pyccn

n = pyccn.Name('/hello/world')
segment = n.appendSegment(42)
